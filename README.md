# Internship
This repo contains:
1. A data analysis mini assignment
2. A project done in collaboration with a fellow intern:
    - Automated the scanning of Indicators of Compromise (IP addresses, file hashes, URLs etc) in infrastructure logs using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and ElasticSearch         to identify security threats
    - Created a simple web app to search for vulnerabilities by inputting MD5 hashes, IPs or URLs. Returns csv file of vulnerable IOCs
